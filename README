This program started life as an optical tracking algorithm that now lives in Tracking/Fiducial.cpp

Now it can do a few things:
	- interact with a few user controls like buttons and a handheld remote
	- supports generic cameras, special Intel R200 support
	- fuse multiple tracking algorithms
	- manage augmented objects with bindings
	- utilize RGBD data for occlusion and occlusion feedback
	- launch and interact with Windows programs
	- dewarp and render to actual see-through AR glasses
	- track the user's eyes for intense immersion

reality/augmented/objects/content must be bound in one of these ways

HUD	-	- content is put on a flat, fullscreen overlay using no tracking of any kind
PARENT	-	- content is attached to a parent object in the real world
WORLD	-	- content exists in the world independant of other objects
PERSONAL	- content floats within reach using a fusion of Compass/IMU/Optical
PURGATORY	- content is not drawn or updated (usually used with WAIT)

Main classes:
	Context	-	-	- Rendering context with built in shaders and passes
	Fiducial	-	- Fiducial marker tracking service
	HandheldInput	-	- Simple input device
	LightTracker	-	- Template for a light tracking service
	PerceptionTracker	- A wrapper class around the R200 scene perception
	PositionTracker	-	- Template for a position tracking service
	R200	-	-	- Specific Intel Realsense R200 implementation
	Scene	-	-	- Holds objects and poses
	SceneObject	-	- Template for augmented objects in scene
	Shader	-	-	- A set of .vert .geo .frag shader source files
	TouchInput	-	- Uses occlusion feedback to implement multitouch
	TrackingService	-	- Puts all trackers together and does fusion
	WindowsIntegration	- Supports sending messages and grabbing screenbuffer
